## Intro

The process of finding the difference of perfect squares involves writing the polynomial as a product of two or more polynomials. 

Every polynomial that contains identical parentheses with a different operation (i.e. ```(a + b)(a - b)```, can be simplified using the following formula and logic:



```
(a + b)(a - b) = (a - b)^2
```

NOTE: In these patterns, ```a``` and/or ```b``` can be replaced by any type of algebraic expression.

For example, if we want to pass in ```(5x + 7y)(6x - 4y)```, where ```a = 8x``` and ```b = 7x``` to the formula, we can. Therefore, the complete process would be:

```
(5x + 7y)(5x - 7y) = (5x - 7y)^2
```

## Example 1: (2x + 8)^2

Suppose we are given the expression ```(2x + 8)^2```.

When applying the Perfect Square Formula, the result would be the following:

```
(2x + 8)^2 = (2x)^2 + 2(2x)(8) + (8)^2
```
## Example 2: (7 + 9)^2

Suppose we are given the expression ```(7 + 9)^2```.

When applying the Perfect Square Formula, the result would be the following:

```
(7 + 9)^2 = (7)^2 + 2(7)(9) + (9)^2

= 49 + 126 + 81

= 256
```
## Example 3: (98x + 54y)^2

Suppose we are given the expression ```(98x + 54y)^2```.

When applying the Perfect Square Formula, the result would be the following:

```
(98x + 54y)^2 = (98x)^2 + 2(98x)(54y) + (54y)^2
```
