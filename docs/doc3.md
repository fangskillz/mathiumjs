## Intro

The Sine is a trigonometric property that allows you to find the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the hypotenuse, as shown:


```
opposite / hypotenuse
```

NOTE: In the three main trigonometric ratios (sine, [cosine], and [tangent]), the triangle must be right in order to perform them.

A clever way of remembering these three ratios and their respective properties is the abbreviation ```SOH CAH TOA```. ```SOH``` is short for ```Sine = Opposite / Hypotenuse```, ```CAH``` for ```Cosine = Adjacent / Hypotenuse```, and ```TOA``` for ```Tangent = opposite / adjacent```.

Let's look at a couple examples to illustrate what sine really looks like in real-life scenarios:


## Example 1: sin(35) = 2.8 / 4.9

Suppose we are given the equation ```sin(35) = 2.8 / 4.9```.

First, let's deconstruct the specific terms of the equation: 

```sin(35)``` represents the fact that we're attempting to find the sine of the angle, which equals 35.

```2.8``` represents the side of the right triangle that is opposite to the angle (35), whilst ```4.9``` represents the hypotenuse of the right triangle.

When applying the formula for finding the Sine of an angle, the result would be the following:

```
sin(35) = 2.8 / 4.9
2.8 / 4.9 = 0.57...
sin(35) = 0.57...
```
## Example 2: sin(39) = 15.39 / 24.45

Suppose we are given the equation ```sin(39) = 15.39 / 24.45```.

First, let's deconstruct the specific terms of the equation: 

```sin(39)``` represents the fact that we're attempting to find the sine of the angle, which equals 35.

```15.39``` represents the side of the right triangle that is opposite to the angle (35), whilst ```24.95``` represents the hypotenuse of the right triangle.

When applying the formula for finding the Sine of an angle, the result would be the following:

```
sin(39) = 15.39 / 24.45
15.39 / 24.95 = 0.629
sin(39) = 0.629
```
