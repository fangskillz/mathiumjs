Ensure that you have the latest version of [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://npmjs.org) installed.

### 1. Installation with npm

```
npm i mathiumjs
```

### 2. Initialization

At the top of your TypeScript file, import `mathiumjs`, as shown:

```ts
import * as Mathium from "mathiumjs";
```

NOTE: The name `Mathium` after `* as` is arbitrary; it can be replaced with whatever you'd like:

```ts
import * as foo from "mathiumjs";
```
